## DATA GENERATOR
Due to the smaller sample size of our weapons.csv, we included a data generator to test the program's capabilities with larger datasets. The current weapons.csv in files has already been filled with the generated data, so their is no need to run it again. It is included in the old data folder, along with the original weapons.csv, to convey the entire process of the project.
